'''19. Write a menu driven program to perform the following functions on strings:
a. Find the length of string
b. Return maximum of three strings
c. Accept a string and replace every successive character with ‘#’ ExampleFor Given string ‘Hello World’ returned string is ‘H#l#o W#r#d’.
d. Find number of words in the given string'''
